# Chat Interface

## Overview

The chat interface allows you to ask questions about your uploaded documents. RetrievAI uses RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to find relevant context and generate accurate responses.

## Using Chat

1. Navigate to the **Chat** section
2. Type your question in the input field
3. Press Enter or click Send

The system will:

1. Search your documents for relevant chunks
2. Use the retrieved context to generate a response
3. Display the answer with source citations

## Tips for Better Results

### Be Specific

Instead of:
> "Tell me about the report"

Try:
> "What were the Q3 revenue figures mentioned in the financial report?"

### Reference Document Content

The AI works best when your questions relate to information actually in your documents.

### Follow Up

You can ask follow-up questions to drill deeper into a topic. The chat maintains context within a conversation.

## Source Citations

Responses include citations showing which document chunks were used. Click on a citation to view the source text.

## Conversation History

- Continue previous conversations
